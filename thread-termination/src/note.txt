thread termination

sometimes we want to terminate those thread

note by default if at least 1 applicable thread exists then application don't stopped. even if main thread finished

1. task completion .
after that thread complete task or job we want to terminate that
because help us to clean up resource

2. application shut down
after you shut down application by some way like System.exit() you want to terminate all threads

3. in web application that use thread per each request if a request get timeout and cant process request we may want to terminate that

4.infinite loop
we use multi thread application for achieving responsiveness and performance
if thread take long time . responsiveness concept is lost



approach we want to implement that interrupt signal and using daemon thread
