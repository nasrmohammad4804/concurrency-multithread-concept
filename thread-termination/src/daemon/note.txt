daemon thread

they are thread that give service to user defined thread

they are background thread that don't prevent application from exiting if main thread terminate
but if we have user defined thread . and at least one of them exists application don't exit until that terminate

daemon used at such scenario that written below

1. using background task that don't main focus on application
for example in text editor consider daemon thread had duty for save text every 10 second
and don't important and consideration while stop text editor app . and app dont wait for those thread to terminated
they are running at background
