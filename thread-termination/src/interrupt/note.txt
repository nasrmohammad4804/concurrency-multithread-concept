2 scenario while using interrupt


1. if application state not run and be on wait or sleep
that may take long time to proceed we use interrupt method on other thread to signal interrupt and InterruptException throw on waited thread

2. if application take long time but on running state for example complex calculation and we don't want to wait for that
we interrupt signal for that thread and handle interrupt signal on block may take time
for after raise interrupt signal in that thread handle that and go out from that
