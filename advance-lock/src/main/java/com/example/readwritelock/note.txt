why we need to use two lock one for write and another for read

race condition
    multiple thread sharing resource and at least one thread modifying that
    solution : complete mutual exclusion regardless of operation (read - write - both)


but consider scenario mostly reading and little modifying such as cache

we had multiple reader and one writer

reentrantLock and synchronization dont allow to have multiple reader access to shared resource
we want to have multiple reader and 1 writer . and if we dont have writer reader concurrently read resource
