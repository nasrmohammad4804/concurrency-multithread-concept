performance had different mean at every use case
for example in backend application mean reducing response time or latency
at machine learning model means have better and precise result


 we need 2 performance definition
 1. latency (reduce time for single task to complete)
 2. throughput ( number of task can be complete at given a period)


 we can achieve latency by divide single task to multiple subtask
