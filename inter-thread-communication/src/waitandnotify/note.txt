as mentioned earlier wait and notify work same as lock and condition

wait() . cause current thread to wait until another thread wake it up
in wait step the thread dont consume any cpu resource because state is blocked and dont scheduled by cpu


2 way for wake up waiting thread :
    notify() : wake up single thread waiting for that object
    notifyAll() : wake upp all thread waiting for that object


for call wait and notify and notifyAll we need to acquire monitor of that object ( using synchronize for that object )

current object as condition variable as well as lock object
