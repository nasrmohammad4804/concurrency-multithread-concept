data race

means share resource modify by one thread and access to by other thread

also sometimes compiler and cpu may execute the instruction out of
order to optimize performance and utilization but also maintaining logical correctness of the code
this feature for rearrange order of execution that change correctness is designed for improved performance and speed by cpu and compiler


compiler re-arrange instruction for better
branch prediction (optimized loop . if statement ...)


synchronized :
    solve both race condition and data race but has performance penalty

volatile :
    solve race condition for read/write to long and double variable
    and solve all data race by guarantee order
